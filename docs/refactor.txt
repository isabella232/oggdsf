Filters crash if you try to right click and view props in graphedit on the output pin

Fix the hardcoded buffer parameters in the decoders

Move dsfSeeking to the Abstract DS library for all

Finish converting the encoders to new abstraacts

Check the CreateAndFillMediaType method... make it protected

Make some of the small libraries static (libilliCore, libOOOggSeeking
, libVorbisComment, libOOOgg??, libCMMLTags, winCMMLParse)

Check the size by making the runtimes static

Check return values for TransformData (should be HRESULTS now... but won't cause compile error
  because previously was long which is equivalent)

Why is the vorbis encoder still on __cdecl... that's a sure fire way for stack corruption.

Check case of includes in all libs that may be cross platform

Check magic number usage.

Check exposure of IMediaSeeking on Filters, input pins and encoders... should only be on
  render filters that wish to seek and output pins.

Do something with the various _cdecl.h files floating around to consolidate them (ie fishsound and theora)

Sort all the GUIDs and format blocks to a common place.

DONE::::

Fix the leaks caused by the accept media types.

Change type of mUptoFrame everywhere to __int64

Check use of mHR which is scattered about the enc/dec filters.
