BUGS
====
* Figure out why the graph hangs at the end of lpayback sometimes. see debugging.txt
* Fix flac decoder
* Fix wmp 9 issues, probably by rewriting the decoder :(
* Add seeking to annodex

* I don't think non-renderer filters should expose the seeking interface.
* Fix up the seeking interface to provide choice of seek method.

# Seeking very close to the end of speex or vorbis files, causes all audio to cease, requiring stop/play to resolve. Particularly noticable in small files, seems roughly 5 secs from end where this occurs.
# There is no way to alter the audio encoding parameters, vorbis defaults to quality 0.3

# Duration is wrong for all files except speex, vorbis and theora... doesn't affect playback
# When transcoding theora, if a media decoder (WMV usually) doesn't advertise its framerate, output may be time distorted
# Created files are not yet gauranteed to be correct. No produced encoded files should be distributed.
# I think there may be a little memory leak in the encoders... nothing too serious, but if you try and encode really large files it may be a problem.
# Theora will not playback with Windows Media Player 9 or 10, but vorbis and speex are just fine, but will in previous WMP's and other DS players like BSPlayer
# Theora and annodex playback requires directX 9.
# CMML decoding requires MSXML3.dll to be present. (it was installed with IE6)
# DON'T try to stop a FLAC stream. It crashes. Running to the end is ok.
# FLAC will make media player do the error sound or crash on exit
# Only plays FLAC with 16 bit 2 channel 44100Hz settings. Still hardcoded.
# Only plays Ogg encapsulated FLAC. Won't play normal FLAC files.

NEXT FEATURES
=============
* CMML Application interface
* Annodex seeking

* Raw flac support
* Annodex Muxer
* WMP Ripping plug-in for vorbis and flac.

DONE
====
* flac encoder
* Add application cmml interface
# Seeking in theora occasionally seg faults (Ithink)
