BUGS
====
* Figure out why the graph hangs at the end of lpayback sometimes. see debugging.txt
* Fix up the seeking interface to provide choice of seek method.
# Seeking very close to the end of speex or vorbis files, causes all audio to cease, requiring stop/play to resolve. Particularly noticable in small files, seems roughly 5 secs from end where this occurs.
# There is no way to alter the audio encoding parameters, vorbis defaults to quality 0.3
# When transcoding theora, if a media decoder (WMV usually) doesn't advertise its framerate, output may be time distorted
# Created files are not yet gauranteed to be correct. No produced encoded files should be distributed.
# I think there may be a little memory leak in the encoders... nothing too serious, but if you try and encode really large files it may be a problem.


NEW
===
* Add get and set functions for the format block to flac encoder like in the others. Get rid of the mecpy.
* Need to check sound buffers are empty when stop/start.
* Need to check code at ends of streams. A seek here stops all audio until stop/start.
* Check directshow apis for flushing.

NOT BUG
=======
# Theora and annodex playback requires directX 9.
# CMML decoding requires MSXML3.dll to be present. (it was installed with IE6)


PARITALLY DONE
==============


NEXT FEATURES
=============

ON HOLD
=======
* Raw flac support
* Annodex Muxer
* WMP Ripping plug-in for vorbis and flac.

DONE
====
* flac encoder
* Add application cmml interface
# Seeking in theora occasionally seg faults (Ithink)
# Only plays FLAC with 16 bit 2 channel 44100Hz settings. Still hardcoded.
* Fix flac decoder
* Add seeking to annodex
# Duration is wrong for all files except speex, vorbis and theora... doesn't affect playback
* CMML Application interface
* Annodex seeking
# DON'T try to stop a FLAC stream. It crashes. Running to the end is ok.
# FLAC will make media player do the error sound or crash on exit
# Only plays Ogg encapsulated FLAC. Won't play normal FLAC files.
* I don't think non-renderer filters should expose the seeking interface.
* Fix wmp 9 issues, probably by rewriting the decoder :(
# Theora will not playback with Windows Media Player 9 or 10, but vorbis and speex are just fine, but will in previous WMP's and other DS players like BSPlayer
