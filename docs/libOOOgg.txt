* Need to enforce max page size restrictions more tightly, some pages go slightly over.

* Need to make sure on a finish stream call to the paginator, if there is nothing buffered,
	it adds the granule pos of the previous page as the graneul pos of the empty EOS page.

* Need a reset method to put paginator in initial state again.

* Doesn't aggressively go for target size.
