The order of installation is important, otherwise all the vcproj files would be
changed upon load:

1. Windows Mobile 5.0 Pocket PC SDK (ARMV4I) - "Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Pocket PC.msi"
2. Windows Mobile 5.0 Smartphone SDK (ARMV4I) - "Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK for Smartphone.msi" 
3. Windows Mobile 6 Professional SDK (ARMV4I) - "Windows Mobile 6 Professional SDK Refresh.msi" 

Or alternatively you can modify the "%VCINSTALLDIR%\vcpackages\WCE.VCPlatform.config" xml file and change
the order of SDKs there.
