text=!! Goals%0a%0aThe aim of this project is to provide the most complete implementation of the [[http://www.xiph.org/ | xiph.org]] codecs for Windows and Directshow. This includes decoders and encoders for all the xiph.org formats as well as [[http://www.annodex.net | annodex]]. It is released under a BSD license, so they can be used by both open-source and commercial applications.%0a%0a!! Current State%0a%0aBesides the directshow filters which many people are familiar with. The source distribution also contains many useful tools, for debugging and validating ogg files, which build on multiple platforms. There is also a .NET media player class which can basically provide an "instant" media player in any .NET application, as well as an early implementation of an apache2 module which can provide server side seeking (currently only of annodex files, but soon also ogg files).%0a%0aMore information about the libraries and tools that are available in the source distribution can be found in the [[Main/DeveloperInfo | developers section]].%0a%0a%0a!!
