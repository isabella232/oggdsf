text=!! How it started...%0a%0aThe Ogg Directshow Filters were written by Zen Kavanagh from Perth, Australia. Zen handed over maintenance of the filters to Cristian Adam in April 2008.%0a%0aHere is what Zen wrote about the history of the Directshow Filters:%0a%0aI first began working on ogg media directshow filters whilst under contract to CSIRO's [[http://www.annodex.net | annodex.net]] project group. Much of the knowledge I needed to write these filters was gained through my work with this project. My initial implementation was for a specific annodex (which uses the ogg encapsulation format) demuxer. Part of my aim of this project was to use the knowledge gained to create a set of filters that works with generic ogg physical streams rather than just a particular physical bitstream format and to release these back to the open source community. There were several limitations to the approach taken to the original annodex filters which is why I decided to start from scratch to design the filter architecture over again with the experience of the first attempt.%0a%0aAnother of my aims of this project is to rewrite the annodex demuxer to use this new design in order for it to be more extensible and easier to work with. This time writing the generic ogg case first and then basing the annodex demuxer on this new design it will increase the consistency of the code between the two modules and provide less trouble integrating new codecs, with the aim of making annodex technology available in the standard applications that come default with windows.%0a%0aI encourage you all to go and check out the [[http://www.annodex.net | annodex project]] and to consider coding some applications to utilise this new technology. There are many interesting possibilities this new technology presents to continuous media and search technology which will expand the internet to be a richer more dynamic multimedia experience.%0a%0aThankyou to CSIRO's annodex.net project group (Silvia Pfeiffer, Conrad Parker and Andre Pang) for the opportunity to work on this exciting new technology and sparking my interest in directshow and the [[http://xiph.org | xiph.org]] range of codecs.%0a%0aOn the 1st of May 2004, this project began to be maintained in the [[http://www.xiph.org | xiph.org]] subversion repository. It can be found at [[http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/oggdsf/ | svn.xiph.org/trunk/oggdsf/]]%0a%0a%0a%0a!! Previous Versions%0a%0aOnly download these if you have problems with the [[Main/Downloads | new version]]. Versions older than 2005 have been removed.%0a%0a%0a!! Previous Version (0.70.0827) - 16/02/2006%0a%0aWow... has it been a whole year :) Yes, this project is still alive! There's a fair bit of new code, so if you have problems you might want to try the [[Main/History | history]] page and get version 0.69. One notable thing that this new version does not do correctly, is it no longer handles chained icecast streams, but it handles streaming static files on a server much better. The previous solution for icecast was a real hack which is no longer possible, it will be fixed properly fairly soon.%0a%0aI'm releasing now, because otherwise you'll be waiting forever! Releases should be coming much more frequently hopefully. As always, email me your bugs and feature requests. The unicode filenames will be fixed as soon as I can, sorry, I keep putting that one off.%0a%0a!!![[(Attach:)oggcodecs_0.70.0827.exe | Download Now (824,581 bytes)]]%0a%0a%0a!!! Changes this version%0a%0a* Theora can seek without artefacts to any frame, even non-keyframes.(95%25 of the time, there's still a slight bug)%0a* All seeking in all codecs is accurate to within a single audio sample (ie. sub-second)%0a* Complete rewrite of demux, it's much easier for me to continue now.%0a* OGM support is improved a bit, still not great. It does not associate with the .ogm extension to avoid messing with other solutions for .ogm you might have. But renaming the .ogm file to .ogg it will attempt to play it.%0a* Improved handling of static files on servers (still not seeking over http)%0a* Be aware that it builds a seektable for all on-disk files. For really large files (>250MB) it may take a little while for the file to load.%0a* Updated most libraries, vorbis is still at 1.1.1, speex still 1.1.10. Another release soonish may rectify this. I just want to release what I've got now, or it will keep being put off.%0a%0a%0a%0a!! Previous Version (0.69.8924) - 15/02/2005%0a%0aLots of bufixes, especially memory leaks and memory management. Along with a new installer based on [[http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ | NSIS]], which is just click-and-run.%0a%0a%0a!!![[(Attach:)oggcodecs_0.69.8924.exe | Download Now (816,782 bytes)]]%0a%0a%0a!!! Changes this version%0a%0a* Removed several major memory leaks in encoders and decoders%0a* More intelligent buffer sizing, reduces memory footprint about 5-10 fold%0a* Much more [[http://www.xiph.org/dshow/uploads/docs/ | documentation]]%0a* Vorbis encoder has programmatic interface for setting quality%0a* Annodex Muxing support%0a* Programmitic interface for encoding progress%0a* Can seek in [=WMP6.4=]%0a* Several other tools (not included in this binary) for server side seeking, and .NET media players added to [[Main/About | SDK]]%0a%0a%0a%0a!!
