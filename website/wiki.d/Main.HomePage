That way, those who just want to play their files can get the stable version, and those who want to live dangerously can get the latest new features without having to wait for me to do proper testing. You can find the '''unstable builds''' on the [[Main/Downloads | download page]].%0a%0aMost users should download the stable version below.%0a%0a%0a!! Current Stable Version (0.71.0946) - 24/02/2006%0a%0aMore bugfixes, particularly to theora. See 0.70 release for more details about recent changes. Docs and source package will be updated on the weekend, there's no major changes there from 0.70. This version is fairly stable now it seems.%0a%0aOgg Codecs for all versions of Windows:%0a%0a!!![[(Attach:)oggcodecs_0.71.0946.exe | Download Now (824,901 bytes)]]%0a%0a%0a!!! Changes this version%0a%0a* Fixed the theora seeking bug, should accurately seek to any frame without artefacts.%0a* Fixed bug not handling WMP doing hardware video acceleration, caused crash on some files (Thanks slashdot!)%0a* Fixed handling of missing 3xx http response codes%0a* Fixed bug where player would crash if you dragged it from one monitor to another while playing%0a* Fixed COM reference double-release bug%0a* Fixed race condition which could crash or hang sometimes after a seek.%0a%0a%0a!!! Known issues%0a%0a* Can't play file with names that use extended character sets (ie Japanese) under certain locales of windows (Thanks Liisachan)%0a* AVI Video files encoded with non-integral framerates (ie 29.97) may lose sync, due to rounding bug (Thanks [=RadicalEd=])%0a* Make the installer properly detect if it's already installed. If you don't uninstall the old version you will get multiple identical file masks in WMP%0a* If you are getting codec problems, there appears to be a conflict with something in Media Player Classic... it tries to enforce the use of another ogg demultiplexer, either by design or accident.If you see in MPC it complaining about a media subtype with a GUID {[=CDDCA2D5-6D75-4F98-840E737BEDD5C63B=]}. This is the guid of the old tobias vorbis filter, and this one {[=8D2FD10B-5841-4a6b-8905-588FEC1ADED9=]} is [=CoreVorbis=]. This is most likely due to the fact that these filters don't clean up the registry when they uninstall. I am working on something to "clean up" all these remnants from the registry (don't expect it too soon though... it's not that high priority). You can also apparently an option to disable the inbuilt demuxer (Thanks Bond)%0a* Cannot handle any chained multiplexed files or streams.%0a%0a%0a!! Other stuff%0a%0a* Also you can encode vorbis, speex, FLAC and theora files using graphedit ([[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9216652f-51e0-402e-b7b5-feb68d00f298&displaylang=en | DirectX9 SDK]]) or other similar program.%0a* [[Main/Graphedit | See audio encoding example filter graphs]]%0a* [[Main/EncTheoraGraphedit | Theora encoding how-to]]%0a* If you install [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/ffdshow | ffdshow ]], you will be able to play ogm files (sometimes at least!)%0a* Also, if you download, install and register [[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82303&package_id=84799 | Gabests .cda directshow source]] you can rip CD's using graphedit%0a* Looking for [[http://svn.xiph.org/releases/oggdsf/ | old versions]] ?%0a* Want the [[(Attach:)oggcodecs_src_0.70.0827.zip | zipped source code]] (10.5 MB zipped, 37MB unzipped) ?%0a* Want to [[http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/oggdsf/ | browse the source on the web]]%0a* [[Main/SseBuilds | Experimental SSE/SSE2 builds can be found here]]%0a* Some basic [[http://www.xiph.org/dshow/uploads/docs/ | API documentation]] for developers%0a
