<b><u><font size="+2">How to encode theora files with directshow</font></u></b><br>

This brief tutorial explains how to use the directshow filter in association with graphedit to encode or transcode ogg theora. It focuses mainly on transcoding, but by using different source filters you can also encode raw data<br>
Graphedit is available in the DirectX9 SDK<br>
<br>

<u><b>Step 1a - Load File</b></u>
After loading up graphedit, from the file menu choose "Render Media File..." and browse to select the file you want to transcode<br>

<br>
<br>

<u><b>Step 1b - Rendered Graph</b></u>
If it was sucessful, you should now have a fully rendered graph, that looks something like this. The exact filters will depends on your source file<br>

<br>
<br>

<u><b>Step 2a - Check media types</b></u>
Right click on the pin that inputs to the video renderer, and choose pin properties<br>

<br>
<br>


<u><b>Step 2b - Ensure YV12 or YUY2</b></u>
On the pin properties page check the media type is either YV12 or YUY2, if it is not, this file can not yet be transcoded directly. If it is then proceed.<br>

<br>
<br>


<u><b>Step 3 - Remove renderers</b></u>
This has rendered a graph for playback, what we want to do it remove the renderers from the graph, and replace them with out encoders and muxer, After removing the renderers, the graph should look something liek this<br>

<br>
<br>


<u><b>Step 4 - Find encoders</b></u>
The first time you will need to find the encoders, by clicking the add filter icon, then selecting the directshow branch of the tree<br>

<br>
<br>

<u><b>Step 5a - Select encoders</b></u>
Find the vorbis encode filter and teh theora encode filter, select each one and check the favourite filter box so next time the filter will be under favourites in the menu, click insert filter<br>

<br>
<br>

<u><b>Step 5b - Encoders Added to graph</b></u>
After the encoders have been added to the graph, it should look something like this.<br>

<br>
<br>

<u><b>Step 6 - Connect the encoders</b></u>
By dragging the ouput pin of the decoder to the input of the encoder connect the filters together<br>

<br>
<br>

<u><b>Step 7 - Open the Theora Encoder Properties</b></u>
Important: *BEFORE* connecting to the muxer, right click the filter and select it's proeprty page.<br>

<br>
<br>

<u><b>Step 8 - Setup the encoder properties</b></u>
Modify the settings and click apply or ok. Future version will include more comprehensive options<br>

<br>
<br>

<u><b>Step 9 - Select Mux Filter</b></u>
Select the Ogg Mux filter as you previously did for the encoders and connect the encoders to it. As you connect a pin a new one will be spawned.<br>
Important: Whichever encoder is at *the bottom* is one that will appear *first* in the encoded file. This means to make a valid theora file, the vorbis stream is added first to the top pin, then the theora stream to the next pin<br>

<br>
<br>

<u><b>Step 10 - Fully connected graph to play</b></u>
The graph is now ready to go, and should look something like this. Press the play button and wait for the encoding to finish. It is finished when the play button goes green again. Close graphedit... don't press play again or it will overwrite the file. Depending on the source format it may show encoding progress in the progress bar, this is however slightly innacurate... the bar will appear to finish before the encoding has really finished. Look at the play button or check your processor to usage to see if it has finished<br>
