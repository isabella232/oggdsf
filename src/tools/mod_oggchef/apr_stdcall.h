/* Apache expects its modules to use a __cdecl calling convention on Windows
   but we link to many libraries which are __stdcall, so it's more convenient
   for us to generate code defaulting to __stdcall.  This means, however, that
   we need to declare any entry points into the module as __cdecl.  Thus, prefix
   add the AP_MODULE_ENTRY_POINT macro below to any functions which Apache
   is responsible for calling.

   the function prototype into fooling the Apache headers that we're __stdcall.
   Ouch.  Use the macros below to do this.
