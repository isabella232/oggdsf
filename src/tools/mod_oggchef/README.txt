mod_oggchef
===========

mod_oggchef is an Apache 2 module which enables the web server to
dynamically recompose media, according to the client's wishes.  It can:

* Serve out only certain tracks (logical bitstreams) from the host's Ogg
  file, by using the HTTP "Accept:" header field.  For example, an HTTP
  request with the header "Accept: video/x-theora" can be used to serve
  out only the video track, with no audio track.

* Serve out the media with a specific time interval via timed URIs.  For
  example, a web client can request playback of the media beginning at 30
  minutes into a movie.


Extracting Tracks
-----------------

Track extraction is performed via the HTTP "Accept:" header.  mod_oggchef
maintains a map of MIME types to logical bitstream formats, as follows:

* application/x-annodex: Annodex-encapsulated file (i.e. serve out the
  entire media file)
* application/ogg & application/x-ogg: Ogg-encapsulated file (i.e. serve
  out the entire media file).  Note that if the host file is an Annodex
  file, the Annodex headers will be stripped off, so a standard Ogg file
  is delivered.
* audio/x-speex: the Speex audio codec encapsulated inside an Ogg
  stream.
* audio/x-vorbis: the Vorbis audio codec encapsulated inside an Ogg
  stream.
* text/x-cmml: CMML metadata.
* video/x-theora: the Theora video codec encapsulated inside an Ogg
  stream.


Timed URIs (server-side seeking)
--------------------------------

NOTE: This is currently broken, so currently, requested timed URIs won't
work (it'll just be served out from the starting time, always).  I'll fix
it up over the next day or two.

Currently, if a media player client wishes to start playback of
a multimedia file from an HTTP server at 15 seconds (i.e. seek to 15
seconds), it has two choices.  It can:

    1.  Download the media file from the beginning, and simply wait until
	15 seconds of data have been received.  This is what many media
	players do.

    2.  Perform a time to byte mapping if the media file format enables
	this, and issue an HTTP/1.1 Range: request, so that the web server
	starts serving the data at the byte specified.  This has the
	disadvantage of being imprecise, and for accurate seeking, the
	client generally has to perform a bisection search (such as
	a binary search) over the network.

With mod_oggchef, the client can ask the web server to play back
a resource at a particular time point by using a timed URI.  As an
example, to play back the media file http://example.com/foo.anx starting
at 15 seconds, the client simply appends the timed URI query '?t=15', e.g.

    http://www.example.com/foo.anx?t=15

The web server is then responsible for delivering the data to the client
at 15 seconds.  For more information on timed URIs, including various
different time scheme formats, see
<http://www.annodex.net/specifications.html>.

Note that mod_oggchef is effectively a re-implementation of the timed
URI capability of mod_annodex <http://www.annodex.net/installation.html>.
mod_annodex is far more powerful, being able to dynamically generate
Annodex media from CMML files, and serve out only the CMML portion of
Annodex media.  These features will be added in the future, though
possibly not to mod_oggchef itself.


Restrictions
------------

* Currently, only Annodex media files are supported.  Support for Ogg
  files will be forthcoming.


Requirements
------------

Windows:

* The official Apache 2 Win32 binary provided as an MSI installer,
  available at <http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi>.  Apache 2.0.52 is
  used for development.

UNIX:

* An Apache 2 installation of some sort with the Apache 2
  development tools (such as apxs).

Note that this module has been tested to work on Linux systems, but
I haven't packaged the build system for it yet (though it's a standard
apxs2 module build).


Building
--------

Windows:

* Windows developers can simply open up the mod_oggchef.vcproj Visual
  Studio project file and build that.  Note that the project file is
  pre-configured to use the standard Apache 2 installation path of
  C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2, and of course requires the Apache
  2 development libraries and headers to be installed.  If your Apache
  2 installation path differs, edit the project properties and adjust them
  accordingly.  (If you have ideas on how to make this easier for
  non-standard installations, let me know.)

UNIX:

* We use a simple apxs-based build system, which is tested on
  Debian GNU/Linux.  You may need to modify some Makefile variables to get
  things working: see the first few lines of the Makefile to see what
  variables to tweak.


Installing
----------

* Add the "application/x-annodex" MIME type to your Apache's mime.types
  file, for file extensions anx, axa and axv.

* Edit your httpd.conf file to enable mod_oggchef by inserting the
  following line:

  LoadModule oggchef_module /path/to/mod_oggchef.so

Windows:

* Copy mod_oggchef.so (and mod_oggchef.pdb, if you want to use the
  Visual Studio Debugger with Apache) to Apache's module directory,
  usually at C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\modules.

UNIX:

* Just run 'make install'.  You may need adminstrator privileges (i.e.
  sudo or su)
