//This holds the preliminary headers for a logical stream... then the output pins of the demux can give them to the codec at their leisure.
//The demux will never present these headers again... seeking to the start of the file will seek to the start
//of the data. ie the first page after the headers.

//More than likely though, you'll have to parse them yourself in the output pin(demuxer) if you want to be able to connect up the codec filter to
//something like the directshow audio renderer... it won't connect unless it knows the sample rate etc... and it
//can't be streamed this data without connecting the filter.

//If the codec needs them again... you have to sort it out from the output pin. The codec should remember !
