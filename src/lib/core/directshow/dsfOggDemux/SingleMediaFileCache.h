//This class will be a cache of a single media file.
//It will only allow a single chunk of data to be cached...
// ie you can't cache bytes 0-1000 and 2000-3000...
// only consecutive blocks for now.
//
//Data can be read randomly... but only written sequentially.
//Will act as a buffer so that data read off the network can be put straight
// into the file and then read as needed.
