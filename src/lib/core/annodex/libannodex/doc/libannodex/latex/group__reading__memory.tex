\section{Reading from memory buffers}
\label{group__reading__memory}\index{Reading from memory buffers@{Reading from memory buffers}}
Sometimes it is not possible to provide a file descriptor for a data source; for example, if the data is extracted from a high level library. In this case, you must directly input the data to libannodex using memory buffers as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item open an annodex using {\bf anx\_\-new()}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{anx__general_8h_a5})}\item attach read callbacks using anx\_\-set\_\-read\_\-$\ast$\_\-callback()\item call anx\_\-reader\_\-input() repeatedly until it returns 0 or -1\item close the annodex with {\bf anx\_\-close()}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{anx__general_8h_a7})}\end{itemize}


This procedure is illustrated in src/examples/print-title-memory.c:
