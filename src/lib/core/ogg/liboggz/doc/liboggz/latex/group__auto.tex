\subsection{Automatic Metrics}\label{auto}
Oggz can automatically provide {\bf metrics }{\rm (p.\,\pageref{group__metric})} for the common media codecs {\tt Speex}, {\tt Vorbis}, and {\tt Theora}, as well as all {\tt Annodex} streams. You need do nothing more than open the file with the OGGZ\_\-AUTO flag set.

\begin{itemize}
\item Create an OGGZ handle for reading with {\em flags\/} = OGGZ\_\-READ $|$ OGGZ\_\-AUTO\item Read data, ensuring that you have received all b\_\-o\_\-s pages before attempting to seek.\end{itemize}


Oggz will silently parse known codec headers and associate metrics appropriately; if you attempt to seek before you have received all b\_\-o\_\-s pages, Oggz will not have had a chance to parse the codec headers and associate metrics. It is safe to seek once you have received a packet with {\em b\_\-o\_\-s\/} == 0; see the {\bf Ogg basics }{\rm (p.\,\pageref{group__basics})} section for more details.

\begin{Desc}
\item[Note:]This functionality is provided for convenience. Oggz parses these codec headers internally, and so liboggz is {\bf not} linked to libspeex, libvorbis, libtheora or libannodex. \end{Desc}
