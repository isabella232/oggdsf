{\bf Writing a CMML file}

Although libcmml was created mainly for the purpose of parsing existing CMML files, it also provides rudimentary support for creating CMML files. This basically consists in providing the data structures for the different tags and API functions to print those tags. There is no validation or sequence checking available for the writing side.

The general sequence of API calls is the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item create a {\bf CMML\_\-Preamble}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{structCMML__Preamble})} with {\bf cmml\_\-preamble\_\-new()}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{cmml_8h_a56})} and print it with {\bf cmml\_\-preamble\_\-snprint()}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{cmml_8h_a73})}\item create a {\bf CMML\_\-Head}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{structCMML__Head})} with {\bf cmml\_\-head\_\-new()}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{cmml_8h_a59})}, change the attribute and element contents in the {\bf CMML\_\-Head}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{structCMML__Head})} structure, and print it with {\bf cmml\_\-head\_\-snprint()}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{cmml_8h_a77})} or {\bf cmml\_\-head\_\-pretty\_\-snprint()}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{cmml_8h_a78})}\item create one or more {\bf CMML\_\-Clip}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{structCMML__Clip})} with {\bf cmml\_\-clip\_\-new()}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{cmml_8h_a60})}, change the attribute and element contents in the {\bf CMML\_\-Clip}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{structCMML__Clip})} structures, and print them with {\bf cmml\_\-clip\_\-snprint()}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{cmml_8h_a79})} or {\bf cmml\_\-clip\_\-pretty\_\-snprint()}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{cmml_8h_a80})}\item print the final \char`\"{}$<$/cmml$>$\char`\"{} tag\end{itemize}


This procedure is illustrated in cmml-write.c:
