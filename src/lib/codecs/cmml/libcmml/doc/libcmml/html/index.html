Introduction</a></h2>
<b>libcmml</b> is a library that provides a complete programming interface including functions, data structures, and sloppy or strict error handling to parse a XML file in CMML. CMML is the Continuous Media Markup Language defined as part of the Continuous Media Web project (see <a href="http://www.annodex.net/software/libcmml">http://www.annodex.net/software/libcmml/</a>).<p>
libcmml also includes the following command-line tools:<ul>
<li><a href="cmml-validate_8c.html">cmml-validate</a>, which takes as input a CMML file and tests it against the <a href="cmml_8dtd-example.html">cmml.dtd</a></li><li><a href="cmml-fix_8c.html">cmml-fix</a>, which fixes a sloppily written input CMML and creates a valid one if possible</li><li><a href="cmml-fortune_8c.html">cmml-fortune</a>, which creates a valid CMML file with random content</li></ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="features">
Features of CMML</a></h2>
The version of CMML that this version of libcmml supports is CMML 2.0 . It has the following features:<p>
<ul>
<li>html-like markup language for audio, video, and other time-continuous data files (call them "media files")</li><li>provides markup to structure an input media file into clips by identification of time intervals</li><li>URI hyperlinking to clips is possible</li><li>provides structured annotations (meta tags) and unstructed annotations (free text) both for the complete media file and each clips</li><li>URI hyperlinks from clips to other Web resources possible</li><li>URI hyperlinks from clips to representative images (keyframes) possible</li><li>internationalisation (i18n) support for markup</li><li>multi-track composition directions for media files from several input media files possible</li><li>several tracks of annotations (multi-track annotations) possible</li><li>arbitrarily high temporal resolution for annotation and media tracks</li><li>non-zero timbase association with media files possible</li><li>wall-clock time association with media files possible</li></ul>

Compiling and Installing libcmml</a></h2>
libcmml is developed in C under Linux and OS X but is easily portable. A Visual C++ MS Windows port is included in the tarball.<p>
libcmml uses expat for parsing XML. Get the appropriate version for your OS from <a href="http://expat.sourceforge.net/">http://expat.sourceforge.net/</a>.<p>
libcmml uses <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">doxygen</a> to create documentation and <a href="http://www.docgook.org/">docbook</a> to create manpages.<p>
To install on Linux, OS X, and other Unix-like OSs run the usual configure, make, make install sequence. Full details in the INSTALL file.<p>
To install on MS Windows you have the choice between a MS Visual Studio version 6 workspace file, a MS Visual Studio version 7 solution, and using nmake with the Win32/Makefile file. Full details in the README.win32 file.<h2><a class="anchor" name="begin">
Programming with libcmml</a></h2>
The libcmml <b>API documentation</b> can be found <a href="globals_func.html">here</a>. The API of libcmml is based on a convenient callback based framework for parsing CMML files. This enables activation of actions for the stream, head and clip tags while reading a CMML file. After opening a CMML file for reading, you attach callbacks to each of these types of tags. Then, as bytes are read, libcmml will call your callbacks as appropriate. Check out the <a href="examples.html">code examples</a> to gain a better understanding.<h2><a class="anchor" name="dtd">
