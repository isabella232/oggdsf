\section{Fish\-Sound, the sound of fish!}\label{index_intro}
This is the documentation for the Fish\-Sound C API. Fish\-Sound provides a simple programming interface for decoding and encoding audio data using Xiph.Org codecs (Vorbis and Speex).

libfishsound by itself is designed to handle raw codec streams from a lower level layer such as UDP datagrams. When these codecs are used in files, they are commonly encapsulated in {\tt Ogg} to produce {\em Ogg Vorbis\/} and {\em Speex\/} files. Example C programs using {\tt liboggz} to read and write these files are provided in the libfishsound sources.

For more information on the design and history of libfishsound, see the {\bf About }{\rm (p.\,\pageref{group__about})} section of this documentation, and the {\tt libfishsound} homepage.\subsection{Contents}\label{index_contents}
