\section{Decoding audio data}
\label{group__decode}\index{Decoding audio data@{Decoding audio data}}
To decode audio data using libfishsound:.  
\begin{itemize}
\item create a Fish\-Sound$\ast$ object with mode FISH\_\-SOUND\_\-DECODE. {\bf fish\_\-sound\_\-new()}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{fishsound_8h_a4})} will return a new Fish\-Sound$\ast$ object, initialised for decoding, and the {\bf Fish\-Sound\-Info}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{structFishSoundInfo})} structure will be cleared.\item provide a Fish\-Sound\-Decoded callback for libfishsound to call when it has decoded audio.\item (optionally) specify whether you want to receive interleaved or per-channel PCM data, using a {\bf fish\_\-sound\_\-set\_\-interleave()}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{fishsound_8h_a14})}. The default is for per-channel (non-interleaved) PCM.\item feed encoded audio data to libfishsound via {\bf fish\_\-sound\_\-decode()}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{fishsound_8h_a7})}. libfishsound will decode the audio for you, calling the Fish\-Sound\-Decoded callback you provided earlier each time it has a block of audio ready.\item when finished, call {\bf fish\_\-sound\_\-delete()}{\rm (p.\,\pageref{fishsound_8h_a11})}.\end{itemize}


This procedure is illustrated in src/examples/decode.c. Note that this example additionally:\begin{itemize}
\item uses {\tt liboggz} to demultiplex audio data from an Ogg encapsulated Vorbis or Speex stream. Hence, the step of feeding encoded data to libfishsound is done within the Oggz\-Read\-Packet callback.\item uses {\tt libsndfile} to write the decoded audio to a WAV file.\end{itemize}


Hence this example code demonstrates all that is needed to decode both Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Speex files:
